This repository contains a Perl script demonstrating a potential bug involving premature loop termination. The script calculates the sum of numbers in an array but may exit the loop before processing all elements if the sum exceeds a certain threshold.  A solution is provided to address this issue by ensuring that the loop always iterates through all array elements before exiting.
